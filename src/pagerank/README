Folder instructions:
- The page rank's source files are placed in this folder.

Requirements:
- Should perform link analysis using the PageRank algorithm, as discussed in class
and in the PageRank paper.
- Should implement PageRank as a MapReduce job.
- May use either Hadoop or HW3 implementation.
- Handle 'dangling links' (pages you have not yet crawled) or PageRank sinks
- Encode the data such that the output of one iteration can serve as input to the next
- Test whether the PageRank values have converged.
- To prevent quality issues, manually inspect some of the values you get, to see how well they correspond
with your intuition of the pages' quality (e.g., Wikipedia vs. some little-known web site).
- Extend your HW3 solution to automatically run multiple instances of a job
