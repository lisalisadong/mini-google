Folder instructions:
- The search engine and UI's source files are placed in this folder.

Requirements:
- Provide a search form and weighted results list.
- Determine how to combine the various factors (PageRank, TF/IDF, other word features)
- Tune ranking function.
- Have a 'debug mode' in which the engine shows additional information about how the
results were ranked, and why (e.g., the raw PageRank scores, the TF and IDF values, and so on).

Milestone 1:
- Build search engine framework with fake data (search and display results)
- Build UI framework (choose an AJAX framework that supports auto-complete)

Milestone 2:
- Integrate search with APIs (e.g. Amazon, Ebay, weather, Yelp, GoogleMap, Wikipedia, etc.)
- Integrate search with real data from database, implement stop-list, root analysis and optimize ranking algorithm

Milestone 3:
- Optimization of ranking algorithm and implement auto-correction mispelled words.
