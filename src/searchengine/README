Folder instructions:
- The search engine and UI's source files are placed in this folder.

Requirements:
- Provide a search form and weighted results list.
- Determine how to combine the various factors (PageRank, TF/IDF, other word features)
- Tune ranking function.
- Have a 'debug mode' in which the engine shows additional information about how the
results were ranked, and why (e.g., the raw PageRank scores, the TF and IDF values, and so on).
